this project is a receration of the Rotating ring dementeration from Tuesaday class and add addtional fetureas. It awile to learn and debug how script used the three.js and dat.gui.js used to create a rotating knot with a gui menue that controls its width on the x,y,and z axis.
As added fietures, I mad a second control menue with dat.gui to control the rotation of the knot on the x,y,z axis. I also created a Help button on top of the screen with pop up text that apperes on the bottom of the screen.
